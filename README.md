# Bookworm

## Overview
Bookworm is an app inspired by my experience learning English through Amazon Kindle. I found the dictionary feature incredibly helpful—whenever I encountered a word I didn’t understand, I could simply click on it to see the translation. It made my reading experience much more enjoyable and easier for me to learn English.

After searching for similar applications with diverse books in different languages, I discovered that most options were limited to children's literature and lacked more engaging content. Now that I have capacity to create apps, I decided to develop Bookworm to fill this gap and enhance my own reading journey.
